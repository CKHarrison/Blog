# README

This is a Ruby on Rails based blog project application based on material from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com) and from [JumpStartLabs](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html#blogger-2). I thought this was a really great project, it helped solidify my knowledge of the MVC
structure and also gave me greater confidence in building my own application. The explanation of adding authentication and authorization really taught me a lot.
You can find the deployed version of my project on heroku [here](https://blooming-badlands-82585.herokuapp.com/).
